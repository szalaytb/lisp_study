# lisp_study

lisp for study and demonstration purposes, tested on SBCL

Tested on SBCL with the LISP IDE made by daansystems.com
Possible best alternatives for following along would be
Corman Lisp (less preferred) or Clozure, CLISP doest not
really support Windows, it is a Mac or Linux thing, and
even then it fails to support some quicklisp libraries.
Oh, and Corman Lisp does not support quicklisp at all.
