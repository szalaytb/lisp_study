# lisp_study

lisp for study and demonstration purposes, tested on SBCL

Tested on SBCL with the LISP IDE made by daansystems.com
Possible best alternatives for following along would be
Corman Lisp or Clozure, CLISP doest not really support
Windows, it is a Mac or Linux thing, and even then
it fails to support some quicklisp libraries.
